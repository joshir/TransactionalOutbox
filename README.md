# Transactional Outbox 

This is a demo consumer microservice thats saves messages received on an input topic to a dedup table, dispatch the message to an output topic, and fire a request to an upstream service, in an all-or-nothing type transactional scenario using [Outbox](https://softwaremill.com/microservices-101/). I plan on using a relational database (Postgresql), Spring/Java and Apache Kafka. I want to guarantee transactional integrity/idempotency of not only messages in the outbox table but also any upstream services that this consumer will dial into. I may opt out of Change Data Capture and rely on a cron job type mechanism to relay the messages in the outbox, especially since CDC is dictated by the choice of database.
